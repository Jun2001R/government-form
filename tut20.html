            <h1>Modi 2.0 (2019-2020)</h1>
            <p>The Modi 2.0 government completes one year in office today. The BJP-led NDA swept to victory in last year’s general election, winning over 350 seats. The verdict came with a heavier load of the public expectations than the previous one and the Modi government moved forward with confidence in fulfilling them. The first year of Modi 2.0 will be remembered for the realisation of decades-old promises of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the massive challenges that it faces in the form of coronavirus to push through its agenda.

                In the first year of the Modi 2.0, the government has taken several key decisions including the abrogation of Article 370, criminalisation of triple talaq, anti-terror terrorism law, Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya case as an incentive.
                
                </p>
                <img class="imgmodi1020"src="https://images.financialexpress.com/2020/05/NarendraModiAmitShah.jpg"alt="error loading">
                <p>BJP vice president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe said that the completion of the first year of Modi 2.0 is all about keeping promises. “It is also about three Cs: Conviction, Courage and Commitment. The first stint was about effective implementation of welfare schemes that yielded remarkable results,” he said, noting that the move on Article 370 and the CAA was very natural after the BJP received a renewed and extended mandate in 2019 elections.

                    From abrogation of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, both have been the two key ideological highlights of the BJP’s manifestoes over the decades, and both issues were settled in the favour of the party in the last one year.</p>
                <h2 style="color: blue;">Article 370</h2>
                <p>Abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, became a primary selling point for the Modi government which came within 100 days of coming back to power. The issue saw politicians divided into two camps, with the Modi government having an upper hand. Many from Congress and other parties sided with the BJP, leaving the opposition leaders baffled. The government said Article 370 abrogation was necessary for full integration of Kashmir into India. It also bifurcated the state into two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir division and Ladakh division, sending a strong message to Pakistan that Delhi was prepared to retaliate in the same capacity. The BJP said that the decision was something that no other government had the courage to do so far. Both Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah didn’t bother about the opposition’s criticism and the decision was widely hailed by citizens. The massive support
                     to the Modi government left the opposition, especially the Congress, embarrassed.</p>
                     <h2 style="color: blue;">Triple Talaq</h2>
<p>Another issue that left the opposition crumbling and gave the BJP an upper hand was the issue of triple talaq. The BJP government succeeded in criminalising the practice of instant divorce among Muslim men and successfully
     pushed through both houses of Parliament despite opposition from its own camp.</p>
     <h2 style="color: blue;">UAPA</h2>
    <p>The Unlawful Activities Prevention Act was amended by the government to give more teeth to agencies. The opposition opposed this but Home Minister Amit Shah put up a strong defence. The government said amendment in the law was necessary to fight terror activities. The amendment conferred power to the government to designate an individual as a terrorist and seize their property.
         However, the opposition’s argument was flattened which called the amendment draconian.</p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">Ram Mandir</h2>
    <p>Then came the Ram Mandir verdict. The construction of Ram Mandir has featured in every election manifesto of the BJP for decades but it won’t feature in election papers of the saffron party anymore as the issue was finally settled by the Supreme Court. The top court ruled in favour of the Ram Mandir which was criticised by many Muslim politicians and religious leaders the community. The verdict paved the way for the construction of
         a temple at the disputed site and the process has already begun.</p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">Citizenship  Act</h2>
    <p>Then came the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The passage of CAA, which seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from three neighbouring Muslim majority countries (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh) on the ground of religious persecution, prompted intense violent protests. It was also one of the key promises made by the party in its manifesto. Opposition parties and social groups have argued that the NRC in conjunction with the CAA can be discriminatory, triggering violent protests. The protests prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to assert that his government has not discussed any move to implement the National Register of Citizens.

        The man behind all such decisions was Amit Shah, the most trusted man of Modi. Shah had served as the Home minister of Gujarat when Modi was the Chief Minister. Between 2014 and 2019, Shah kept himself away from the government’s functioning but Modi roped in Shah after the 2019 victory, displaying his intention that the next five years will see some decisions that the previous governments lacked courage to do. Shah rightfully emerged as the second most visible and powerful voice of the government as he piloted the government’s decisions related to Jammu and Kashmir, UAPA and CAA among others.
        
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: blue;">India China Conflict</h2>
        <p>The 2020 China–India skirmishes are part of an ongoing military standoff between China and India. Since 5 May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops have reportedly engaged in aggressive melee, face-offs and skirmishes at locations along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake in Ladakh and the Tibet Autonomous Region, and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes are ongoing at locations in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has persisted since the 1962 Sino-Indian War.

            In late May, Chinese forces objected to Indian road construction in the Galwan River valley. According to Indian sources, melee fighting on 15/16 June 2020 resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers (including an officer) and casualties of 43 Chinese soldiers (including death of an officer). Several news outlets stated that 10 Indian soldiers, including 4 officers, were taken captive and then released by the Chinese on 18 June. An unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers were also captured and later released by India.
            
            Amid the standoff, India reinforced the region with 12,000 additional workers, who would assist India's Border Roads Organisation in completing the development of Indian infrastructure along the Sino-Indian border. Experts have postulated that the standoffs are Chinese pre-emptive measures in responding to the Darbuk–Shyok–DBO Road infrastructure project in Ladakh. The Chinese have also extensively developed their infrastructure in these disputed border regions. The revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, in August 2019, by the Indian government has also troubled the Chinese. However, India and China have both maintained that there are enough bilateral mechanisms to resolve the situation through quiet diplomacy.
            
            Following the Galwan Valley skirmish on 15 June, numerous Indian government officials said that border tensions will not impact trade between India and China despite some Indian campaigns about boycotting Chinese products. However, in the following days, various types of action were taken on the economic front including cancellation and additional scrutiny of certain contracts with Chinese firms, and calls were also made to stop the entry of the Chinese into strategic markets in India such as the telecom sector.</p>
            <h3 style="color: crimson;">Pangong Tso</h3>
            <img class="imgmodi2020"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Inked_Ni-44-9-chushul-china-india_cropped_v2.jpg/400px-Inked_Ni-44-9-chushul-china-india_cropped_v2.jpg"alt="error loading">
            <p>On 5 May, the first standoff began as a clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers at a beach of Pangong Tso, a lake shared between India and Tibet, China, with the Line of Actual Control (LAC) passing through it. The Indian soldiers involved in the clash were from 17 Kumaon Regiment. A video showed soldiers from both nations engaging in fistfights and stone-pelting along the LAC. On 10/11 May, another clash took place. A number of soldiers on both sides had sustained injuries. Indian media reported that around 72 Indian soldiers were injured in the confrontation at Pangong Tso, and some had to be flown to hospitals in Leh, Chandi Mandir and Delhi. According to The Daily Telegraph and other sources, China captured 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) of Indian-patrolled territory between May and June 2020.

                After the clash, several Chinese military helicopters were spotted flying near the Indian border on at least two occasions. India deployed several Sukhoi Su-30MKI jets to the area. Reports that Chinese helicopters had repeatedly violated Indian airspace were denied by the Indian government. There were reports of Chinese soldiers approaching Indian soldiers with improvised weaponry of barbed wire "sticks". By 27 June, the Chinese were reported to have increased military presence on both the northern and southern banks of Pangong Tso, strengthened their positions near Finger 4 (contrary to what the status quo was in April), and had even started construction of a helipad, bunkers and pillboxes. Satellite imagery from between 12 and 26 June, by Planet Labs shows that the Chinese army increased infrastructure between Finger 4 and 5 on a massive scale, which includes tents, trenches, water tanks and stationed equipment and vehicles along with some camouflaged structures. However, no Chinese helipad and ammunition could be visible from the images. They even inscribed the ancient name of China, Zhongguo (Central state) along with the present day map of China on the shore of the lake between Finger 4 and 5. Both countries have multiple high powered boats for patrolling the Pangong Lake which is 13,900 feet above sea level. While the Indian Army already had multiple boat patrolling teams stationed, the Indian Navy, in July 2020, was called in to match the presence of the Chinese Type 928 B vessels at the lake.</p>
        <h3 style="color:crimson;">Galwan Valley</h2>
        <p>On 15 June, Indian[f] and Chinese troops clashed for six hours in a steep section of a mountainous region in the Galwan Valley. The immediate cause of the incident is unknown, with both sides releasing contradictory official statements in the aftermath. Beijing said that Indian troops had attacked Chinese troops first, while on 18 June The Hindu quoted a "senior government official" in the Ministry of External Affairs of India who said their troops were ambushed with dammed rivulets being released and boulders being thrown by Chinese troops. The statement said this happened while they were patrolling a disputed area where Colonel Santosh Babu had destroyed a Chinese tent two days earlier. While soldiers carry firearms, due to decades of tradition designed to reduce the possibility of an escalation, agreements disallow usage of firearms, but the Chinese side is reported to possess iron rods and clubs. As a result, hand-to-hand combat broke out, and the Indians called for reinforcements from a post about 2 miles (3.2 km) away. Eventually, up to 600 men were engaged in combat using stones, batons, iron rods, and other makeshift weapons. The fighting, which took place in near-total darkness, lasted for up to six hours. According to senior Indian military officers, Chinese troops used batons wrapped in barbed wire and clubs embedded with nails.

            The fighting resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers of 16th Bihar Regiment including its commanding officer, Colonel Santosh Babu. While three Indian soldiers died on the spot, others died later due to injuries and hypothermia. Most of the soldiers who were killed fell to their deaths after losing their footing or being pushed off a ridge. The clash took place near the fast-flowing Galwan River, and some soldiers from both sides fell into a rivulet and were killed or injured. Bodies were later recovered from the Shyok River. Some Indian soldiers had also been momentarily taken captive. According to Indian media sources, the mêlée resulted in 43 Chinese casualties. At a de-escalation meeting following the incident, the Chinese side accepted that the Chinese commanding officer was also killed in the mêlée. The Chinese defence ministry confirmed the existence of Chinese casualties but refused to share the number. Later on, when asked about an Indian minister's assertion about the number of Chinese casualties, China refused to comment. U.S. intelligence reportedly concluded that 35 Chinese soldiers were killed. Indian media reported that 10 Indian soldiers were released from Chinese custody in 17 June, including four officers. Responding to the reports, the Indian army and the Chinese foreign ministry have both denied that any Indian personnel was taken into custody.
            
            On 16 June, Chinese Colonel Zhang Shuili, spokesperson for the PLA's Western Command, said that the Indian military violated bilateral consensus. He further remarked that "the sovereignty over the Galwan Valley area had always belonged to China". On 18 June, India's Minister of External Affairs made a statement saying that China had "unilaterally tried to change the status quo" and that the violence was "premeditated and planned". The same day, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs said that the Chinese PLA had "invaded" the "contested area" between India and China. On 19 June, however, Prime Minister Modi declared that "neither have [China] intruded into our border, nor has any post been taken over by them", contradicting multiple previous statements by the Indian government. Later the Prime Minister's Office clarified that Narendra Modi wanted to indicate the bravery of 16 Bihar Regiment who had foiled the attempt of the Chinese side. On 22 June, U.S. News & World Report reported that U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that the chief of China's Western Theater Command had sanctioned the skirmish.
            
            In the aftermath of the incident at Galwan, the Indian Army decided to equip soldiers along the border with lightweight riot gear as well as spiked clubs. In the meantime, the Indian Air Force also had started the process for emergency procurement of 12 Sukhoi-30 MKI and 21 Mikoyan MiG-29 from Russia. On 20 June, India removed restriction on usage of firearms for Indian soldiers along the LAC. Satellite images analysed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute show that the Chinese have increased construction in the Galwan valley since the 15 June skirmish. The Chinese post that was destroyed by Indian troops on 15 June was reconstructed by 22 June, with an expansion in size and with more military movement. Other new defensive positions by both Indian and Chinese forces have also been built in the valley</p>
             <h3 style="color: crimson;">PM Modi’s surprise visit to Ladakh is a game-changer</h3>   
            <img class="imgmodi3020" src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/07/04/Pictures/pm-modi-in-ladakh_a91d0820-bd80-11ea-9fb0-50c382f93f50.jpg"alt="error loadin image">

        <p>A range of experts and analysts believe that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Ladakh, and his speech to troops in the frontlines of the stand-off at the Line of Actual Control, is a possible “game-changer”, an expression of India’s “resolve” to beat Chinese aggression, a clear articulation of Indian redlines, and a message to China that since Beijing broke the relationship, it will have to fix it.

Brahma Chellaney, a strategic analyst, suggested that after a period “a concerted government effort to downplay the Himalayan border confrontation and obscure China’s encroachments”, Modi’s visit to the Ladakh front had helped shine a spotlight on the “war-like situation” India confronts.

“His speech underscores India’s resolve to beat back the Chinese aggression. And his reference to ‘expansionism’ echoes the mounting international concern over China’s imperial overreach under Xi Jinping, who has simultaneously opened multiple fronts.”</p>
<p>In a reference to the PM’s speech at an all party meeting where he had appeared to suggest that there was no external intrusion (subsequently clarified by the Prime Minister’s Office as only pertaining to the situation in Galwan valley), Chellaney said, “By going to Ladakh, Modi has made amends for the confusion he sowed with his June 19 televised speech on the border situation.”

    Lieutenant General (retired) Syed Ata Hasnain said that the visit was a “game-changer”, and a part of India’s continuous “strategic messaging”.
    
    “Measures to convey a strong resolve through economic and other domains get hugely supplemented when the PM personally appears at the frontlines. The PM spoke of India’s pursuit of peace and development but that should not be construed as lack of resolve to defend its territorial integrity. Besides the morale boost to troops, the visit will force a Chinese review of its strategy of coercion it has adopted.” Hasnain added that it was a message to the world to stand up to “China’s hegemonistic ambitions”.The message of the speech, Sushant Sareen of the Observer Research Foundation said, was clear. “The door to diplomacy is open and every effort will be made to solve the situation peacefully. At the same time, a redline has been drawn. The PM’s address was a statement of resolve to not back down in face of Chinese bullying, threats and intimidation.”

    Sareen also saw a longer-term shift in India’s posture in the speech. “Most importantly, it is clear that the PM, who invested a lot in trying to win over China, has now given up. India-China relations are broken, even if this situation gets resolved. It will now take a lot to bring normalcy in the relationship and, as far as India is concerned, all heavy lifting will have to be done by China because it is responsible for damaging the relationship. They broke it, they must fix it.”</p>
<p>But there were also voices which suggested that there must be a more cautious reading of the speech and what it represented.

    Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany, State University of New York and a scholar of South Asian security, said that the PM gave a “boilerplate speech”.
    
    “His praise for the sacrifice and bravery of India’s jawans, while heartfelt, was also the least he could do after the events of the last two months. His assertion that the age of expansionism was over perhaps suggests his earlier assurances that China had not expanded into Indian territory were incorrect.”But, he added, that by going to Leh, the PM made “a modest implicit commitment”. “While he did not promise to avenge the fallen, as he did after the 2019 Pulwama attack, his speech would make any further Chinese encroachments on the frontier somewhat more embarrassing. This was not a game changing speech, nor was it a concession that the game was over.”
