            <h1>7 Best Qualities of Narendra Modi</h1>

            <p>He is undeniably regarded as the “Bhai” of Indian politics. Here we mention seven material
                 qualities of NaMo which make him the best prime minister India ever had:</p>
                 <h2 style="color: blue;">Public Speaking Skills</h2>
                 <img class="imgmodi1021" src="https://825872.smushcdn.com/1369323/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/public-speeking.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1"alt="error loading">
                 <p>Loads of research is a prerequisite when you have to deliver a speech as a large mass of people has gathered to hear and learn from you. This quality is well observed in our prime minister. Even his criticizers claim not to miss any speech from him as it leaves them spellbound.

                    It is not because someone writes his speeches but because of good oratory skills, the man possess. “Refer to your Google guru. Get enrolled in public speaking courses there; try youtube, which also has similar programs,” he said in an interview on teachers’ day.</p>
                    <h2 style="color: blue;">Discipline</h2>
                    <img class="imgmodi2021" src="https://825872.smushcdn.com/1369323/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/discipline-150x150.png?size=225x225&lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1" alt="Error loading">
                <p>This is one thing that everyone should learn and realize from him. From the days of being a balswayamsevak in RSS to now as being the prime minister of India, Modi has never left his discipline regimen. Modi proves that he has no tolerance for laid-back attitude, and
                     he wants all his cabinet ministers on toes for the progress of the country.</p>
                     <h2 style="color: blue;">Love For Technology</h2>

He is active on social media platforms and keeps updating his daily happenings and decisions through his Facebook posts and tweets. He is not a slave of technology
                          but a lover of tech which makes him the most famous prime minister amongst the youth.</p>
                <h2 style="color: blue;">Leadership</h2>

                <p>Narendra Modi’s journey from a chai wala at Gujarat platform to making his residence at 7, Race Course Road defines a lot about his leadership qualities. He appreciates those who work hard by monitoring their performance on day to day basis. Modi sets an example for
                     his ministers during times of uncertainty and provides reassurance to them.</p>
                <h2 style="color: blue;">Enthusiasm</h2>
                <img class="imgmodi5021" src="https://825872.smushcdn.com/1369323/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/enthu.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1"alt="Error loading image">
                <p>At the age of 64, the passion and dedication of Narendra Modi are worth mentioning. He plays drums in Japan and answers questions in interviews with confidence and vigor. He becomes a source of inspiration and motivation for his team members which draws the
                     trust out of them and encourages them to work harder to achieve their targets.</p>
                <h2 style="color: blue;">Patience</h2>
                <img class="imgmodi6021"src="https://825872.smushcdn.com/1369323/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/patience-356x220.jpeg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1"alt="Error loading image">
                <p>A man who leads the country must possess patience and not jump like a kid before making any decision. A full proof planning and homework are required to give a conclusion. A good leader should not be overpowered by emotions or be impulsive or get angry at petty things. 
                    Narendra Modi is calm and composed and does not let the storms and crises affect him.</p>
                <h2 style="color: blue;">Determination</h2>
                <p>With a clear vision and focus, this chai wala was determined to achieve something commendable in life. His hard work and charismatic personality made his dreams come true. He has an exemplary character and is always committed to excellence.

                    A man who possesses such high qualities will surely take India
                     to a new level and work wonders for the country.</p>
