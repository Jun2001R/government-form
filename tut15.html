       <h1 class="coronaheading" >ACTION OF P.M. AGAINST CORONA VIRUS</h1>
       <br><div id="coronacontent"class="virus"><p>Prime Minister Narendra Damodar Das Modi played a big role in this pandameic. Due to their efforts and proper arrangements of treatment, we are secure in corona virus pandameic.
           At 24th March Lockdown  started in country and then apporx 500 cases were in our country.Due to good decision of Lockdown, expansion of corona virus in country became too late. Till that time, 
        arrangement of testing kits, beds, vantiltors, masks, ppe kits and other things like  ambulances were properly done in every Hospitals.
    establishments of companies for manufacturing of testing kits, Many medicines and fulfill the demand of oxygen gas cyclinders in hospitals, these were the big challenges which had completed by Modi's Government
and period of Lockdown was a wonderful time for achieving these big goals. But some Jamaties decieved to country. They spread it in whole country, they 
opposed to government and threw stones on police and presented his bad mentality for country. Due to lockdown country beared a big loss in economy so this lockdown could not carry on for long time.
 so after lockdown 3 the process of unlocking started. but since 24th march proper amount of beds and other things are arranged.
now India is in condition to face this disease. India had distributed hydrochloroprine to whole world. the population of India is about 137 crore but here no of cases are about 9.5 lakh .
Really 9.5 lakh is not a small number but this virus is more dangerous than this situation. see America, where population is about 32 crore and density of population is lower than India , there situation is not in control.
In over country mostly cases are from eight states and  in rest places no. of cases are less. the rate of recovery is increasing in our country and with in two months may be the rate of new cases will less.
our medical scientist and research labs are working for vaccine may be  till last september any vaccine could be launched of corona virus. I request to every one please wear mask and concentrate on your immunity.</p>

                 <br><p>Our prime Minister every time is working only for 137 crore Indians . During Lockdown many person lost their Jobs many Labourers who earns Daily and then eat meal , many auto drivers , sellers , shopkeepers, hotel Manager and may be every one faced economical problem in this lockdown.
                    But labourers , auto drivers faced big problem because their earning source stooped totaly so they started to return their homes because without any income to stay in big cities is not possible. while government distributed lunch packates in every places yet
                    without money to stay at any place for one month very difficult. At lockdown no trains were available so labourers started to go their home by foot. Many of them covered hundreds kilometers by foot.
                    When prime minister viewed this condition then they started trains with maintaining social distancing. central Government offerd 85% on rail fare.
                    and in uttar pradesh remain 15% fare is offerd by state government and also distributed 1000/- to every labour.
                    first every traveller had to stay in 14 days quarentine centre. <div class=""></div>

                      <p>At this crisis many political leaders started their politics as congress, samajvadi party and many parties. But central government helped every 
                          state equally.government launched a app "Arogya setu". but some leaders also show their disatisfaction for this app. They said it is dangerous for user's data security.
                          but they never show any disatisfaction for chinese apps which are really a big problem of security.<br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Made by:<br> Shivansh Bajpai<br>Harshita Bajpai </span>
