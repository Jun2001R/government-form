                    <h1>Background</h1>
                    <p style="font-family: cursive;">Narendra Modi was born in the small town of Vadnagar, in northern Gujarat, India. His father was a street merchant who struggled to support the family. Young Narendra and his brother sold tea near a bus terminal to help out. Though an average student in school, Modi spent hours in the library and was known as a strong debater. In his early teens, he joined Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student 
                        wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist political party.</p>
                        <h1>Education and attraction towards politics </h1>
                    <p style="color: crimson;">SSC – 1967 from SSC board, Gujarat; BA  in Political Science a distance-education course from Delhi University, Delhi; PG MA – 1983 Gujarat University,
                         Ahmedabad (acc. to the affidavit before Election Commission)</p>
                         <p>In 1967, he had completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar. At the age of 8 years, he joined Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He doesn’t want to marry so he left home at the age of 17 and travelled across the country for the next two years. In his interviews, he told that in these two years he visited several ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda. Then Modi returned to Vadnagar and after some time he again left for Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with his uncle,
                              who worked in the canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.Let us tell you that in 1970 that is at the age of 20, he was so influenced by the RSS that he became the full-time Pracharak and he
                               had formally joined RSS in 1971 at the age of 21. In his area, in the early 1970s, he set up a unit of RSS's students wing namely Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. No doubt, his association with the organisation has significantly benefited his political career.  He has completed the Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning at the University of Delhi and later he had completed his Master degree
                               in political science from Gujarat University.</p>
                        <p>In his childhood days, he had faced several difficulties and obstacles, but he took all the 
                            challenges positively and transformed them into opportunities by courage and strength. After joining
                             RSS, he learned the spirit of selflessness, social responsibility, dedication and nationalism.</p>
