                <h1 style="font-family: cursive;">Name and Birth place: </h1>
                <div style="font-family: cursive;font-size: 20px;"><p>Narendra Modi was born on 17th September 1950. The birthplace of Narendra Modi is Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay
                     State (present-day Gujarat). For your information, Narendra Modi’s full name is Narendra Damodardas Modi.

                    Moreover, his father’s name was Mool Chand Modi and his Mother is Hiraben. 
                    Narendra Modi always belonged to a middle-class family. His engagement with 
                    Jasoda Ben Chaman Lal took place at the age of 13. However, he got married at the age of 17.</p>

                    <h1>Background</h1>
                    <p style="font-family: cursive;">As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and said that he later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus. Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre. Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students noted this.
                         Modi preferred playing 
                        larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.</p>
                        <h1>Education and attraction towards politics </h1>
                    <p style="color: crimson;">SSC – 1967 from SSC board, Gujarat; BA  in Political Science a distance-education course from Delhi University, Delhi; PG MA – 1983 Gujarat University,
                         Ahmedabad (acc. to the affidavit before Election Commission)</p>
                         <p>When eight years old, Modi discovered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor. While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980.

                            Also in Narendra Modi's childhood, in a custom traditional to his caste, his family arranged a betrothal to a girl, Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when they were teenagers.Sometime thereafter, he abandoned the further marital obligations implicit in the custom,and left home, the couple going on to lead separate lives, neither marrying again, and the marriage itself remaining unmentioned in Modi's public pronouncements for many decades. In April 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed 
                            that he was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged.</p>
                        <p>Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he went have emerged. In interviews, Modi has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education. Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's life.

                            In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. Modi then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968–69. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad. There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.
                            
                            In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner) for the RSS, working under Inamdar. Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to mentor him. Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of Inamdar, published in 2001.
                            
                            In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from School of Open Learning at University of Delhi, graduating with a third class. Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class as an external distance learning student</p>
